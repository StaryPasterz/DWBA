Abstract. W e present the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) for electron
impact excitation and a method to calibrate the DWBA. W ith th e calibrated DWBA, the
differential cross sections (DCS) for excitation of H and He + from 1s to 2s and 2p are
calculated and the results are compared with the absolute ex perimental measurements
for H at incident energies of 50 eV and 100 eV . It has been found that the theoretical
results are in very good agreement with the experiment, whic h conﬁrms the validity
of the calibration procedure. This work prepares an efﬁcien t theoretical method for
numerical simulations of non-sequential double ionizatio n of He in strong laser pulse
in which laser-induced electron impact excitation of He + is involved.

1 Introduction
The process of electron impact excitation of atoms and ions i s one of the most basic and
important processes in atomic physics. Theoretical invest igations of such problems are
of not only practical interest but also more fundamental int erest. Numerous theoretical
methods have been proposed for calculations of differentia l cross sections (DCS) for elec-
tron impact excitation, including the distorted wave Born a pproximation (DWBA) [1,2],
the second-order distorted wave model [3], the convergent c lose-coupling (CCC) calcula-
tions [5], and the R-matrix method [4], among which the DWBA is the simplest. The so-
phisticated theoretical models, such as the CCC and the R-matrix method, are supposed
to be able to reproduce accurate DCS in angular distribution and absolute magnitude as

well at low incident energies. On the other hand, for high ene rgies, both the total cross
sections (TCS) and the DCS predicted by DWBA are in fairly goo d agreement with the
absolute measurements. However , it has been well recognize d that, at low energies, the
TCS predicted by the DWBA substantially overestimates the e xperimental values. “Ide-
ally , one could use the R-matrix approach for low energies, the DWBA for high energie s,
and the two theories would yield the same results for interme diate energies. Unfortu-
nately , we do not live in an ideal world [6].”
The purpose of this work is to calibrate the DWBA for electron impact excitation of
H and He + at low energies by employing the empirical formula proposed by T ong et al.
[7]. This calibration procedure has been previously applie d to correct the overestimate of
DWBA on the DCS for electron impact excitation of Ne and Ar [8] .
Our ultimate objective is to apply the calibrated DWBA to sim ulate the correlated
momentum distributions in nonsequential double ionizatio n (NSDI) of He in strong laser
ﬁelds [9,10].
The process of NSDI is one of the laser-induced rescattering processes, which still re-
mains one of the most interesting and challenging topics in s trong ﬁeld physics. Both
electron impact ionization and electron impact excitation of ions could be involved in
NSDI. In the last two decades a lot of experimental measureme nts have been performed,
particularly noteworthy are the correlated momentum distr ibutions of the two outgo-
ing electrons which were measured at the turn of this century [11]. In the meantime, a
number of theoretical efforts have been devoted to this prob lem as well. In one of the the-
oretical models, which was developed by Chen et al. [12,13], the correlated two-electron
momentum spectra can be treated as a product of the wave packe t for laser-induced
returning electrons and the differential cross sections fo r the laser-free electron impact
excitation and/or ionization of the parent ion. In the pract ical simulations of the cor-
related electron momentum distributions for NSDI, one need s to evaluate the DCS for
electron impact excitation of the parent ion to all possible excited states at all incident
energies from threshold to the maximum returning electron e nergy which is usually less
than 200 eV . Due to the heavy computational demand, relative ly simple and efﬁcient the-
oretical approaches are highly desired. Since the shape of t he DCS predicted by DWBA is
typically in fairly good agreement with the experimental me asurements, once the over-
estimate of DWBA on the DCS is corrected, the calibrated DWBA can serve as a good
candidate for such required theoretical tools.
The organization of this paper is as follows: In Section 2, th e theory of DWBA for
electron impact excitation is presented in detail and the me thod to calibrate DWBA is
proposed. In Section 3, the normalization factors for DWBA a t incident energies below
1000 eV are given for electron impact excitation of H and He + from 1s to 2s and 2p,
and the calibrated DCS of DWBA for H at 50 eV and 100 eV are compa red with the
experimental measurements. Furthermore, some calibrated DCS of DWBA for H and
He+ at four different incident energies below 100 eV are analyze d. And ﬁnally some
conclusions are drawn in Section 4.
Atomic units are used in this paper unless otherwise speciﬁed .

2 Theory
In this section, we present the general form for DWBA theory i n detail on electron impact
excitation of atoms which can be easily applied to electron i mpact excitation of ions. A
method used to calibrate the DWBA at energies below 1000 eV is also given.
2.1 Basic equations
The problem to be considered here is inelastic electron-ato m ( e- A) scattering. The Hamil-
tonian for such a process is given by
H = −1
2 ∇2
r1 +
VA+ (r1 )− 1
2 ∇2
r2 +
VA+ (r2 )+ 1
r12
, (1)
where r1 and r2 are the position vectors for the projectile and the bound sta te electron
with respect to the nucleus, respectively . In Eq. (1), VA+ is the effective potential based on
single active electron approximation, which takes the form as
VA+ (r) =−1+a1 e−a2 r +a3 re−a4 r +a5 e−a6 r
r (2)
where the parameters ai , as given explicitly in table 1 in T ong and Lin [14], were obta ined
by ﬁtting the calculated binding energies of the ground state and the ﬁrst few excited
states of the target atom using this potential to the experim ental data. Both the exact ini-
tial state wavefunction Ψ i (r1,r2 ) and the ﬁnal state wavefunction Ψ f (r1,r2 ) of the system
satisfy the Schr ¨ odinger equation
HΨ j (r1 ,r2 ) =EΨ j (r1 ,r2 ) ( j =i, f ), (3)
where E is the total energy .
Since Eq. (3) cannot be solved analytically , one has to emplo y approximate Hamilto-
nians, which can be expressed as
Hj = −1
2 ∇2
1+
Uj (r1 )− 1
2 ∇2
2+
VA+ (r2 ) ( j =i, f ), (4)
where Ui (U f ) is the distorting potential used to calculate the wavefunc tion χki (χk f ) for
the projectile in the incident (exit) channel with momentum ki (k f ). With this approxi-
mation, the initial (ﬁnal) state wavefunction can be express ed as a product of the initial
(ﬁnal) state wavefunction for the projectile and the wavefun ction for the bound electron
in the ground (excited) state.
The initial and ﬁnal state wavefunctions for the projectile s atisfy the differential equa-

In the distorted wave Born approximation, the direct transi tion amplitude for excita-
tion from an initial state Φ i to a ﬁnal state Φ f is given by

where Vi is the perturbation interaction,

where ˆr1 and ˆki are the unit vectors denoting the directions of r1 and ki , and Ylm are the
spherical harmonics. Similarly , the partial wave expansio ns for the scattering electron

In this work, all continuum waves are normalized to δ(k −k′). For a plane wave, the
radial component χl (k,r)/kr in Eqs. (11) and (12) is a standard spherical Bessel function
jl (kr).

In the scattering amplitude (8), the perturbation potentia l is the last remaining quantity

can be expressed as

2.4 Distorting potentials
In the DWBA model, the distorting potentials Ui and U f which are used in Eq. (5) to
evaluate the wavefunctions for the projectile in the initia l and ﬁnal states respectively
play important rule in the numerical calculations, since th e calculated DCSs are sensitive
to the distorted wavefunctions describing the projectile. Unfortunately , neither Ui nor U f
is determined directly by the formalism. Here, we use static potentials which take the
form as
Uj (r1 ) =VA+ (r1 )+
∫
dr2
|Φ j (r2 )|2
r12
(j =i, f ). (31)
As shown previously , VA+ (r) in Eq. (31) is the atomic potential used to evaluate eigen-
state wave functions Φ i and Φ f for the bound electron in the initial and ﬁnal states,
respectively . Obviously , the distorting potentials given by Eq. (31) for electron impact
excitation of atoms are neutral asymptotically .
2.5 Calibration of DWBA
T o evaluate the total cross sections for electron impact exc itation, T ong et al. [7] employed
an empirical formula
σT ong(Ei ) = π
∆ E2 e1.5(∆ E−ǫ)/Ei f
( Ei
∆ E
)
, (32)
where
f (x) =1
x
[
β ln x +γ
(
1− 1
x
)
+δ ln x
x
]
, (33)
with ∆ E is the excitation energy for a given transition and ǫ is the eigenenergy of the
corresponding excited state in atomic hydrogen. The parame ters β, γ and δ in Eq. (33)
have been obtained initially by ﬁtting the TCS to the converge nt-close coupling (CCC)
results for hydrogen from 1s to 2p and further tested for e−+He+(1s) → e−+He+(2p).
However , it has been found that, with the parameters given in Ref. [7], the formula
Eq. (32) fails to predict the correct values of the TCS for exc itation of other atoms and
ions. Even for H and He +, the TCS for excitation to other excited states reproduced b y
Eq. (32) are much higher than the CCC data and the shape of the T CS as a function of
incident energy does not agree with the CCC very well, either .
T o adjust the overall difference in magnitude, we introduce a prefactor α to modify
the empirical formula, which is given by
σM-T ong(Ei ) =α π
∆ E2 e1.5(∆ E−ǫ)/Ei f
( Ei
∆ E
)
. (34)

Z. -J. Lai, D. -F . Chen, L. -Q. Pan, et al. / J. At. Mol. Sci. 5 (2014) 311-323 319
It should be noted that, in Eq. (34), ǫ denotes the eigenenergy of the corresponding excited
state in target atoms or ions. In the present work, we apply th e same ﬁtting procedure
as in Ref. [7] to obtain the parameters. For excitations of H a nd He + from 1s to 2s, the
parameters we obtained are β=0.7638, γ=1.1759, and δ=0.6706, which are different from
those in Ref. [7]. It has been found that with this set of param eters, the TCS reproduced
by Eq. (34) are in better agreement with CCC in shape. These pa rameters are further
tested by comparing the predicted excitation cross section with CCC for excitations of H
and He + from 1s to 3s and 4s. For excitations of H and He + from 1s to np ( n=2, 3 and 4),
the parameters are β =1.32, γ =−1.08, and δ =−0.04. The prefactor α is then determined
by matching the TCS from Eq. (34) with the CCC data at high ener gies.
It should also be noted that the TCS of CCC are not available fo r most atoms or ions.
Hence, the applicability of the above ﬁtting procedure to exc itation of other atoms and
ions is quite limited. Fortunately , both the DCS and the TCS o f DWBA are reliable at high
energies. Therefore, the prefactor α can be obtained by matching the TCS from Eq. (34)
with the DWBA results at high energies, say 1000 eV , provided that the parameters β, γ
and δ remain the same for all target atoms and ions.
The total cross section of DWBA at ﬁxed incident energy Ei =k2
i /2 can be obtained by
integrating the DCS of Eq. (18) over scattering angles:
σDWBA (Ei ) =
∫ dσ
dΩ d ˆk f . (35)
T o calibrate the DWBA at low energies, we deﬁne a normalizatio n factor
C(Ei ) =σM-T ong(Ei )/σDWBA (Ei ). (36)
By multiplying the DCS of DWBA by the normalization factor at each incident energy ,
one obtains the calibrated DWBA as
( dσ
dΩ
)
C
= C(Ei ) dσ
dΩ . (37)
3 Results and discussion
T o obtain the normalization factors to calibrate the DCS of D WBA, we calculate the TCS
from the empirical formula of Eq. (34) and the TCS of DWBA. The results are shown
in Figs. 1 and 2 for excitations of H and He +, respectively . The corresponding CCC re-
sults [15] are also plotted for comparison. It can be seen tha t the CCC data for excitation
from 1s to 2s are reproduced very well for both H and He + while for excitation from 1s
to 2p slight differences exist. Whereas, the agreement betw een the TCS of T ong and CCC
can be improved if the TCS of T ong at 1000 eV is ﬁtted to CCC rathe r than DWBA. The
reason that we ﬁt the TCS of T ong at 1000 eV to DWBA instead of CCC is that DWBA
results are always available.

The absolute experimental measurements of Khakoo et al [16] for electron impact ex-
citation of the 1 2 S → 22 S +22 P levels of H at incident energies of 50 and 100 eV provide
the excellent possibility of a stringent test for the presen t calibration procedure. It is illus-
trated in Fig. 3 that the calibrated DWBA DCSs follow the expe rimental data very well

over the whole angular region for both incident energies. T o see the contributions from
the excitations of 1 2 S →22 S and 1 2 S →22 P separately , the corresponding theoretical DCSs
of the calibrated DWBA are also plotted in Fig. 3 for comparis on. One can see that the
excitation of 1s to 2p dominates the forward scattering for a ngular region from 0 ◦ to 45 ◦
at 50 eV and 0 ◦ to 30 ◦ at 100 eV . On the other hand, the excitation of 1s to 2s can not b e
neglected in the region of larger scattering angles.
In Fig. 4 we show the differential cross sections of DWBA weig hted by the normal-
ization factors for excitations of H from 1s to 2s and 1s to 2p a t incident energies of 15,
25, 50 and 100 eV , respectively . The slope of DCSs for both exc itations of 1s to 2s and 1s
to 2p changes more rapidly at larger scattering angles as inc ident energy decreases. In
addition to the slope change, extra minima are reproduced by the DWBA around 70 ◦ for
excitation of 1s to 2p and 100 ◦ for 1s to 2p at 15 eV .

of 45, 60, 80, and 100 eV, respectively.
Fig. 5 shows the similar results for excitations of He + at energies below 100 eV . Com-
pared to the excitation of H, enhanced backward scattering D CSs are predicted by the
DWBA due to larger Coulomb attraction to the scattered elect ron since large angle scat-
tering takes place when the projectile approaches closer to the nuclear of He such that it
sees more charge than the nuclear charge of H. As a result, a mi nimum appears in the
DCSs for both excitation of 1s to 2p and 1s to 2p at 45 and 60 eV . B oth of the depths and
positions of the minimum in DCSs have signiﬁcant physical imp ortance since they reﬂect
the structure information of the targets. In addition, with the increase of incident energy ,
the angle at which the slope changes does not move as much as th at for H, which even
almost remains ﬁxed at 110 ◦ for the excitation of He + from 1s to 2p, as shown in Fig. 5(b).

4 Conclusions
W e present a method to correct the overestimate of DWBA on the TCSs for electron im-
pact excitation of H and He +. The purpose of this work is to apply the calibrated DWBA
to simulate the correlated momentum distributions for lase r-induced nonsequential dou-
ble ionization of He. The calibration method is based on two a ssumptions: (1) the relative
angular distributions of the DCSs predicted by the DWBA at lo w incident energies are
fairly accurate, and (2) the TCSs reproduced by the DWBA at hi gh incident energies are
reliable. The validity of the calibration method is conﬁrmed by the agreement between
the DCSs obtained by the calibrated DWBA and the absolute exp erimental measurements
for excitations of H from the ground state to n=2 state. The calculated DCSs with the cal-
ibrated DWBA for excitations of H and He + from 1s to 2s and 1s to 2p below 100 eV are
also presented and the structure of the DCSs is analyzed.
